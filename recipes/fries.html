  <h2>Description</h2>

    French fries, those golden-hued, crispy delights, are a beloved side dish or snack. Made from potatoes
    cut into various shapes,most commonly thin strips, they are deep-fried until golden brown and often
    sprinkled with salt. Their versatility shines through their ability to be enjoyed plain, dipped in 
    ketchup or other sauces, or even topped with more substantial ingredients like cheese and gravy. 
    Whether enjoyed hot and crispy or soft and fluffy, fries remain a universally adored comfort food.
